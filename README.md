IO protocol

This protocol works over UDP (datagrams)

This is a full complete worldwide digital protocol for enonomics exchanges.
It enable to exchange 'leaf' money between humans only.
The Leaf is a free money supply crypto spring.

At any time, the sum of all balances of all registered human is always null.
Any balance if always bounded, like a spring, in a symetric interval [-MAX, +MAX]
The balance is null at registration (birth or adult age) and at death.
No compagny nor administration, nor foundation can have an account, only alive human can.
There is no interest of any kind. You can stay all your life at -10.000 leafs if it is allowed by MAX value.
Leaf is a pure money, enabling delay in the past of in the future for dissynchronised exchanges of goods or services. This is not a store of value. Leaf really facilitate exchange without side effects like other moneys or crypto-money.

A human being can only have one account. This is verified by a shared public (web) neural network that discriminates people.

Each account is reachable with a smartphone that store the private cryptographic key. Certification and transaction are based on signature (ECDSA or EdDSA) enabled with a strong authentication using three criteria:
- something you carry (smartphone, watch,...)
- something of your body (face analysis, fingerprint,...)
- something you know (PIN, password)

The IO protocal also manages incomes produced by objects/robots.
This is the protocol for mecanical slavery. Objetcs are working for you if you own them.

This solves the problem of capital bad distribution among people in the world, because anyone can invest in robots to get an income from produce wealth.

Please, try to hach this protocol ;-)
